# Real-Time Stock Data Streaming and Analysis

## Overview

This project is designed to retrieve real-time stock data, perform streaming data analysis using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark, store data in InfluxDB, and visualize the data with Grafana. It aims to provide insights into the stock market and allow users to monitor stock prices effectively.  General information regarding the stock is also retrieved and stored onto a Postrgesql database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Kafka, Spark, InfluxDB, and Grafana images available in your Docker environment
- Stock symbols and necessary API keys if applicable

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-stock-analysis.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd real-time-stock-analysis
   ```

3. Run the Docker Compose file to set up the project environment:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Access the different services:

   - Apache Kafka: http://localhost:9092
   - Apache Spark: http://localhost:8080
   - InfluxDB: http://localhost:8086
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3000

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
├── producer/              # Python scripts to produce stock data
├── consumer/              # Spark Streaming consumer
├── logs/                  # Log files generated by the application
├── docker-compose.yml     # Docker Compose configuration file
├── .env                   # Environment variables for the project
├── README.md              # Project documentation (this file)
```

## Usage

- **Producer**: The producer scripts (located in the `producer` directory) are responsible for retrieving real-time stock data using APIs and sending this data to Kafka topics.

- **Consumer**: The Spark Streaming consumer (located in the `consumer` directory) processes the real-time data, performs analysis, and stores it in InfluxDB.

- **Data Visualization**: Grafana can be used to visualize the stock data stored in InfluxDB. You can create dashboards and panels to display stock prices, trends, and more.

## Data Flow

1. Real-time stock data is retrieved using the producer scripts and sent to Kafka topics.

2. The Spark Streaming consumer reads data from Kafka topics, performs data analysis, and stores the results in InfluxDB.

3. Grafana is used to visualize and monitor the stock data stored in InfluxDB.

## Configuration

- Configuration for various services, such as Kafka, Spark, InfluxDB, and Grafana, can be found in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

- Environment variables can be configured in the `.env` file.
